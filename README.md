# Public CORS-Anywhere Server

This project is a clone of [cors-server](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server). See the readme there for more on the implementation instructions. The purpose of this server is to whitelist URLs for users that could not deploy their own server on a per-request basis. It is recommended that users try all available options before making a request. It should only be for very low traffic sites so that usage limits are not reached.


## Proxy URLs

The proxy server has been hosted on both Firebase and Fly.io.

**Firebase:** `https://proxy-pqrhttcdvq-uc.a.run.app/`

**Fly.io:** `https://cors-server.fly.dev/`
