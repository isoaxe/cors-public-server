# Public CORS-Anywhere Server

This project is a clone of [cors-server](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server). See the readme there for more on the implementation instructions. The purpose of this server is to whitelist URLs for users that could not deploy their own server on a per-request basis. It is recommended that users try all available options before making a request. It should only be for very low traffic sites so that usage limits are not reached.


## Proxy URLs

Just on Firebase for now.

`https://proxy-pqrhttcdvq-uc.a.run.app/`


## Whitelisted Addresses

The following addresses have been given access to the `cors-public-server` on Firebase:
