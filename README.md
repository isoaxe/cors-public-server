# Public CORS-Anywhere Server

This project is a clone of [cors-server](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server). See the readme there for more on the implementation instructions. The purpose of this server is to whitelist URLs for users that could not deploy their own server, which is recommended.


## Proxy URLs

Currently just a server on Firebase has been set up. Did not bother with Fly yet.

**Firebase:** `https://proxy-pqrhttcdvq-uc.a.run.app/`
